## Frogger game

This project demonstrates a recreation of the classic 'Frogger' game, developed in Assembly language. It serves as the midterm project for CS 447, Assembly and Computer Organization.

## Installtion

Firstly, dowload the MIPS simulator. Mac users should use [MARS for mac](https://github.com/JarrettBillingsley/MARS_Assembler/raw/master/downloads/Mars_2241_0830-4.5.22410830.dmg), and Windows users should use [MARS for Windows](https://github.com/JarrettBillingsley/MARS_Assembler/raw/master/downloads/Mars_2241_0830-4.5.41830.exe). Note that the simulators we use here are modified versions of MARS, credited to the course lecturer, Jarrett Billingsley. Other versions of MARS may not recognize the syntax presented in the file.

After MARS is downloaded, download all files in the repository. Make sure that all files are in the same diretory. Then, open `boh24_proj1.asm` and execute the file. With that set-up, then go to the menu bar of MARS. Click `tool`, and select `Keypad and LED Simulator`, and then click `connect to MIPS`. You should see the following display:

Now you can start to play! Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the frog: Up (↑) to move forward, Down (↓) to move backward, Left (←) to move left, Right (→) to move right. You have three lives, and the goal is to jump to the frog-like positions across the river. When all 4 positions are filled, you win the game!
