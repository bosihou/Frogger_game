## Frogger game
This project demonstrates a recreation of the classic 'Frogger' game, developed in Assembly language. It serves as the midterm project for CS 447, Assembly and Computer Organization.

## Installtion
Firstly, dowload the MIPS simulator. Mac users should use [MARS for mac](https://github.com/JarrettBillingsley/MARS_Assembler/raw/master/downloads/Mars_2241_0830-4.5.22410830.dmg), and Windows users should use [MARS for Windows](https://github.com/JarrettBillingsley/MARS_Assembler/raw/master/downloads/Mars_2241_0830-4.5.41830.exe). Note that the simulators we use here are modified versions of MARS, credited to the course lecturer, Jarrett Billingsley. Other versions of MARS may not recognize the syntax presented in the file.

After MARS is downloaded, download all files in the repository. Make sure that all files are in the same diretory. Then, open `boh24_proj1.asm` and execute the file. With that set-up, then go to the menu bar of MAR. Click `tool`, and select `Keypad and LED Simulator`, and then click `connect to MIPS`. You should see the following display:
